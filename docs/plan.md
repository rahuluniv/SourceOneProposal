### How to Use This Plan

*   **Timeboxes:** Each sprint is two calendar weeks; stick to backlog grooming at sprint start.
    
*   **Deliverables:** At the end of every sprint, produce a demo build and updated documentation.
    
*   **Quality Gates:** After each module-level UAT, schedule a “go/no-go” decision before proceeding.
    
*   **Stakeholder Reviews:** Incorporate bi-weekly demos, especially after Sprints 2, 4, 6, and 8.
